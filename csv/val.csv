1," I have been using pandas for a while and it worked fine but out of nowhere, it decided to give me this error 

AttributeError(""module 'pandas' has no attribute 'read_csv'"")

Now I have spent many many hours trying to solve this issue viewing every StackOverflow forum but they don't help. 

I know where both my cvs + python files are located.
My script is not called cvs.py or anything such.
My code can literally just be `'import pandas as pd' and I get the
no attribute error.

I would appreciate if someone could spare the time + assist me in solving this problem.? "," I have faced the same problem when I update my python packages using conda update --all.
The error:
AttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute 'read_csv'
I believe it is a pandas path problem.
The solution:
print(pd)
To see where are your pandas come from. I was getting
<module 'pandas' (namespace)>
Then I used to print(np), for example, to see where my numpy is, then I got
<module 'numpy' from 'C:\\Users\\name\\Anaconda3\\envs\\eda_env\\lib\\site-packages\\numpy\\__init__.py'>
I used the same path to find my pandas path. I found out that the folder lib named Lib with an uppercase letter. I change it to lowercase lib, and it solves my problem.
Change Lib to lib or check a working module and make sure pandas have the same.</s>"," I have been using pandas for a while and it worked fine but out of nowhere, it decided to give me this error

710," I'm trying to label images with the various categories that they belong to with a convolutional neural net.

Currently I'm using scipy.interpolate's RectBivariateSpline to do this, but I want to be able to define edges of my field by setting certain values in the grid to NaN.

Apparently this is an error in the scipy fitpack, so what would be the best way to work around this? I want to be able to keep the NaNs in the grid to work with edges and out of bounds later on, but I don't want it to affect the interpolation in the rest of the grid.?

No, because anything in the image that is not annotated as an object is classified as background, which is an implicit object type/class.

Yes, this can help. Also, you can consider adding multiple bounding boxes for each image.

You can use them on structs, but it is probably not a good idea:

holes in the structs get written and read
you're baking in the endianness of your integers

Thanks heaps!?  The C library functions fread(3) and fwrite(3) will read and write 'elements of data', but that's pretty fanciful way of saying ""the C library will do some multiplication and pread(2) or pwrite(2) calls behind the scenes to fill your array"".
You can use them on structs, but it is probably not a good idea:

holes in the structs get written and read
you're baking in the endianness of your integers

While you can make your own format for writing objects, you might want to see if your application could use SQLite3 for on-disk storage of objects. It's well-debugged, and if your application fits its abilities well, it might be just the ticket. (And a lot easier than writing all your own formatting code.)</s>"

Stefan? ", I thing Voting Classifier only accepts different static weights for each estimator. However you may solve the problem by assigning class weights with the class_weight parameter of the random forest estimator by calculating the class weights on your train set.</s>," I was wondering if it is possible to use dynamic weights in sklearn's VotingClassifier. Overall i have 3 labels 0 = Other, 1 = Spam, 2 = Emotion. By dynamic weights I mean the following:
I have 2 classifiers. First one is a Random Forest which performs best on Spam detection. Other one is a CNN which is superior for topic detection (good distinction between Other and Emotion). What I would like is a VotingClassifier that gives a higher weight to RF when it assigns the label ""Spam/1"".
Is VotingClassifier the right way to go?
