The decision about whether to lowercase everything is really dependent of what you plan to do.  For some purposes, lowercasing everything is better because it lowers the sparsity of the data (uppercase words are rarer and might confuse the system unless you have a massive corpus such that the statistics on capitalized words are decent).  In other tasks, case information might be valuable.
Additionally, there are other considerations you'll have to make that are similar.  For example, should ""can't"" be treated as [""can't""], [""can"", ""'t""], or [""ca"", ""n't""] (I've seen all three in different corpora).  What about 7-year-old?  Is it one long word?

650," I've been trying to set up an LSTM model but I'm a bit confused about batch_size. I'm using the Keras module in Tensorflow.
I have 50,000 samples, each has 200 time steps and each time step has three features. So I've shaped my training data as (50000, 200, 3). 
I set up my model with four LSTM layers, each having 100 units. For the first layer I specified the input shape as (200, 3). The first three layers have return_sequences=True, the last one doesn't. Then I do some softmax classification.
When I call model.fit with batch_size='some_number' do Tensorflow/Keras take care of feeding the model with batches of the specified size? Do I have to reshape my data somehow in advance? What happens if the number of samples is not evenly divisible by 'some_number'?

If your dataset size is not divisible by the batch size, Keras will have the final batch be smaller and equal to dataset_size mod batch_size.</s>"," I've been trying to set up an LSTM model but I'm a bit confused about batch_size.

1031," I am trying to load a CCITT T.3 compressed tiff into python, and get the pixel matrix from it. It should just be a logical matrix. 
I have tried using pylibtiff and PIL, but when I load it with them, the matrix it returns is empty. I have read in a lot of places that these two tools support loading CCITT but not accessing the pixels. 
I am open to converting the image, as long as I can get the logical matrix from it and do it in python code. The crazy thing is is that if I open one of my images in paint, save it without altering it, then try to load it with pylibtiff, it works. Paint re-compresses it to the LZW compression. 
So I guess my real question is: Is there a way to either natively load CCITT images to matricies or convert the images to LZW using python??

Of course, if the source was not from cache and the array was already writable, then they would duplicate the data unnecessarily.

1142," Wonder if anyone can help.
I have a set of lists of numbers, around 300 lists in the set, each list of around 200 numbers. What I wish to calculate is the ""relative stability"" of each list.
For example: 
List A: 100,101,103,99,98 - the range is v small - so stable.
List B: 0.3, 0.1, -0.2, 0.1 - again, v small range, so stable.
List C: 0.00003, 0.00002, 0.00007, 0.00008 - stable.
Now, I could use standard deviation - but the values returned by the standard deviation will be relative to the values within each list. So std for list C would be tiny in comparison to std for list A - and therefore numerically not give me a comparable measure of stability/volatility enabling me to meaningfully ask: if list A more or less stable than list C?
So, I wondered if anyone had any suggestions for a measure that will be comparable across such lists?
Many thanks for any help.

It's hard to talk about closeness threshold, since it depends greatly on other parameters (# nodes, # edges,...). 
One thing you can know for sure is that every closeness centrality is somewhere between 2/[n(n-1)] (which is minimum, attained at path) and 1/(n-1) (which is maximum, attained at clique or star).
Perhaps better question would be about Freeman centralization of closeness (which is somehow normalized version of closeness that you can better compare between various graphs).

You can do a grid search for different cutoff values and then choose the one that makes more sense based on your application.</s>"," Hi I have a file that consists of too many columns to open in excel.

I tried to pass 10x6 dimension, in hope it would work, but it just throw up the error.?  As Malvolio was (indirectly) going about, I personal wouldn't find a use for prime factorization if you want to find factors in a range, I would start at int t = (int)(sqrt(n)) and then decremnt until1. t is a factor2. Complete util t or t/n range has been REACHED(a flag) and then (both) has left the range

I prefer python side, but c++ side is also okay.? "," according to Graves paper [1], the loss for a batch is defined as sum(log(p(z|x))) over all samples (x,z) in this batch.
If you use a batch size of 1, you get log(p(z|x)), that is the log-probability of seeing the labelling z given the input x. This can be achieved with the ctc_loss function from TensorFlow.
You can also implement the relevant parts of the Forward-Backward Algorithm described in Section 4.1 of the paper [1] yourself.
For small input sequences it is feasible to use a naive implementation by constructing the paths shown in Figure 3 and then sum over all that paths in the RNN output.
I did this for a sequence of length 16 and for a sequence of length 100. For the former one the naive approach was sufficient while for the latter one the presented dynamic programming approach was needed.

Numpy expects all the data to be laid it in a simple, strided pattern.  When iterating over the array, to advance in a dimension, it adds a constant, the stride size for that dimension, to the position in memory.  So unless your 2-d slices are laid out regularly (e.g. every other row of a larger 3-d array), numpy will need to copy the data.
If you do have that order, you can do what you'll want.  You'll need to make a PyArray struct where the data points to the first item, the strides are correct for layout, and the descr is correct as well.  Most importantly, you'll want to set the base member to another python object to keep your big chunk of memory alive while this view exists.</s>"," I am using LightGBM 2.0.6 Python API.

I  know that in R some of the classifiers (decision trees, random forests) can directly handle missing values without your having to do any imputation.
Can any of the classifiers in scikit learn 0.16.1 do likewise and if so, how should I represent the missing values to help it?  
I have read discussions on the scikit learn github about this topic but I can''t work out what has actually been implemented and what hasn't.?  RandomForests in scikit-learn don't handle missing values at the moment [as of 0.16 and upcoming 0.17], and you do need to impute the values before.</s>"

For fitting, you need the polyvander2d, polyvander3d functions that create the design matrices for the least squares fit. The multi-variable polynomial coefficients thus determined can then be reshaped and used in the corresponding evaluation functions. See the documentation for those functions for more details.</s>"

But I want to go further. What I would like to do is just to give the full pictures and output the entire text (not one character such as in my previous model).
Thank you in advance for any help.?  The difficulty is that you don't know where the text is. The solution is, given an image, you need to use a sliding window to crop different part of the image, then use a classifier to decide if there are texts in the cropped area. If so, use your character/digit recognizer to tell which characters/digits they really are.
So you need to train another classifer: given a cropped image (the size of cropped images should be slightly larger than that of your text area), decide if there are texts inside.
Just construct training set (positive samples are text areas, negative samples are other areas randomly cropped from the big images) and train it~</s>"

4978," I am trying to optimize functions with GPU calculation in Python, so I prefer to store all my data as ndarrays with dtype=float32. 
When I am using scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b, I notice that the optimizer always passes a float64 (on my 64bit machine) parameter to my objective and gradient functions, even when I pass a float32 ndarray as the initial search point x0. This is different when I use the cg optimizer scipy.optimize.fmin_cg, where when I pass in a float32 array as x0, the optimizer will use float32 in all consequent objective/gradient function invocations. 
So my question is: can I enforce scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b to optimize on float32 parameters like in scipy.optimize.fmin_cg?
Thanks!? "," I am not sure you can ever do it. fmin_l_bfgd_b is provided not by pure python code, but by a extension (a wrap of FORTRAN code). In Win32/64 platform it can be found at \scipy\optimize\_lbfgsb.pyd. What you want may only be possible if you can compile the extension differently or modify the FORTRAN code. If you check that FORTRAN code, it has double precision all over the place, which is basically float64. I am not sure just changing them all to single precision will do the job.
